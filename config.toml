This blog is where I explore those questions—diving into platform engineering, cloud strategies, software architecture, and technology transformations. I don’t just describe solutions; I challenge assumptions and dig into the details, aiming to spark thought and uncover better ways of doing things. If you’re curious and like questioning the status quo, you’ll feel right at home here."
