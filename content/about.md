# About me
My Name is Alex Elshamouty,

TL;DR:

An architect and an engineer with a strong knowledge in the infrastructure and software delivery domain, focusing on creating feedback loops between technical strategy and business strategy.

- I excel in dynamic and evolving environments that requires advanced technical and people skills. 
- My defination of an Architect is inspired from [Gregor Hohpe's](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/multiple-dimensions/) analogy of seeing multiple-dimensions, Being an architect for me means that one needs to see multiple dimensions, have the needed in-depth and breadth of knowledge required to lead complex transformational programs.
- I write regurarly about technology, with an emphasis on the Cloud domain.
