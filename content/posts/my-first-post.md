## Introduction

For years, I have been planning to start a blog, write about my thoughts, and improve my story writing skills.

I am not much of a "take a class" person, I learn by doing, and I wanted to enhance my writing and story telling skills.

Since I work as an Architect, the aspect of story telling is extreamly important. Focusing on the right details and showing the right information in the right context is crucial, in any job I would argu.

And what better way to do that that to write about what am I doing, the challanges i've seen and learnt from.

This blog will be a combination of multiple topics, with a focus on the following three:

- Technology: as a driver and enabler for business
- People: an important, yet not always obvious, aspect of any organisation
- Reviews: My general thoughts on the things I have read, how it helped me, and how it can help you

Hopefully you will learn something from me, or maybe through discussion, I can learn something from you!
